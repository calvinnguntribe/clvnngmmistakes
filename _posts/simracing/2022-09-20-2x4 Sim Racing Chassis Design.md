By popular reddit demand I'm brining back the 2X4 design and permanently host it here. 
Previous hosting sites eventaully went down, so I decided to move it to github here for everyone to retrieve. 

On a personal note, I can't believe I made this in 2015. I've come a long way in terms of a sim racing setup and just life in general. It's really nice that there is still a small community around this design and I still get dm'ed for the drawings every now and then. For the people who are just getting into sim racing, welcome! Thank you for the support. You can find me on reddit at u/clvnng. Give me a message if you found this valuable! I hope to find you on iracing :). 

Here is the .pdf. Enjoy!
