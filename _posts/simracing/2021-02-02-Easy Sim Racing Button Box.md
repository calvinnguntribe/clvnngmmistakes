The purpose of this project is to design a quality button box with off the shelf parts and easy to assemble. 
The majority of the time was spent designing the enclosure to ensure I only had to use bolts to assemble everything together.
The alternative is to use a project box but I really didn't want to drill holes and I wanted to just plug a USB right into the side of the box. 

Here some features of the design: 
- holes pre made for buttons
- standoffs to mount the the control board encoder are provided
- usb holes are aligned for easy plug and play
- easy to find parts for quick repairs 

All the parts can easily be found amazon for about $40USD shipped.

Required Hardware:
- 12 - Buttons (WayinTop 20pcs Momentary Push Button)
- 6 - Momentary toggle switches (mxuteuk 6pcs MTS-123 3 Terminal 3 Position SPDT momentary)
- 2 - Zero Delay Encoders with USB (Reyann Zero Delay Arcade USB Encoder)
- 4 - M3*20mm Hex socket head to assemble the enclosure
- 4 - M3*8mm Hex socket head to mount the 2 control. The alternative is to all 8 holes but that would be a bit overkill.  

The part that took the longest was soldering the momentary toggle switches, the rest of the assembly took 20min. Im very happy how everything turned out. The enclosure was printed on a Prusa3D with Galaxy Black PLA. Gives it a really nice composite look.

The Zero Delay Encoders are plug and play onto a PC, no drivers required. The reason for using two encoders is it can only support 12 buttons each. Each momentary switch is 2 buttons and I had 6 (2x6=12) and I also had 12  red buttons, for a total of 24 buttons.

Here you can see how I soldered the 3 poles to the momentary switches. White wires on the outside and the two blue wires soldered together for the middle pole.
